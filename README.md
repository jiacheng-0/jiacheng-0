## Personal Info

- **Name**: Teo Jia Cheng
- **Role**: Java Software Engineer

## Personal Intro

I am an early career Software Engineer with 3 years of experience in payments, full stack development, and testing. During my time at Visa, I have completed three rotations, gaining valuable experience in various aspects of software engineering. In my most recent role, I worked in an agile software engineering team where I handled frontend, backend, and infrastructure tickets. One of my significant projects involved migrating the entire codebase from Java 8 to Java 17, utilizing technologies such as Spring Framework 6, Hibernate, JPA, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Additionally, I have experience with Linux servers and Jenkins for deployment.

In a previous rotation, I developed a Spring Boot tool for data preparation on the test platform, using a stack that included Java 8, AngularJS, and MongoDB. I have also interned at NinjaVan and EY, where I further honed my skills. My expertise lies in Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and Linux deployment. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring healthy food places, swimming, and going to the gym. I am also passionate about cooking and continuously improving my diet. I occasionally return to my alma mater, Singapore Management University (SMU), to attend software engineering workshops and volunteer as an alumni mentor for current students.
